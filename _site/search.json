    "text": "This is my first post of the blog. Welcome!\nI hope you‚Äôve had a chance to read ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section, which will reflect an up-to-date version of who I am. As of writing this ‚ÄòWelcome‚Äô Post, I have finished my 2nd year Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) exams. I‚Äôm currently spending my summer vacation, sadly, without a summer internship (yet). So, I took a personal project for myself, and what could be better than starting a blog?\nI‚Äôm also pursuing a career to become an Actuary, so preparing for my CS2 exam which is scheduled for September 2025. This blog will be a productive outlet for myself and even helpful for my career.\nI feel like I‚Äôve reached a where I can apply what I‚Äôve learned over the years ‚Äî in mathematics, statistics, finance, accounting, programming, etc, in a more practical manner. I‚Äôve learnt basics of R Programming through taking CS1 Exam, and the basics of Python through an introductory course in college. Beyond that, internet has no limit, many great books teaching me more, like ‚ÄòR for Data Science‚Äô by Hadley Wickham, and ‚ÄòPython for Data Analysis‚Äôby Wes McKinney and a lot more out there!\nThis blog is my way of putting that knowledge into action by simplifying topics, writing for an audience, and getting over my hesitation to share publicly. Who knows, maybe I‚Äôll find great people who will read my blogs and take interest in connecting with me and who‚Äôll actually find my blogs helpful.\nI‚Äôve been an above-average kid for most of my life, lucky to be born-and-raised in Delhi, by my wonderful parents and an elder brother who‚Äôs three years older than me. I chose Commerce field as the major in college (which I kind of regret), because it was supposedly an easier major, I hadn‚Äôt decided what I really wanted to do at that point of time. Looking back, if I could choose again, I‚Äôd probably go for Economics or Statistics. But commerce gave me the freedom to explore, and learn whatever I wanted, but it also limited my formal learning in some ways.\nMy interest in statistics and probability really began in 12th grade only. I wasn‚Äôt confident back then, so I chose the best college I could with my entrance exam score ‚Äî Shaheed Bhagat Singh College, University of Delhi, is located in South Delhi. I, like some people, have a love-hate relationship with my college. I did find good college friends who I could spend time with, and the crowd has a variety with some genius people to some no-shit given people. It has been hectic juggling college life with a professional degree on the side, especially when the commute to the college is over 1.5 hours one sided! The attendance policy is strict, and due to construction, they also had to close down sports ground (goodbye volleyball ‚Äî my love üòî).\nEver since I was a kid, whatever my brother did, liked, I also tried and did. He requested our father for a computer when I was 6 or 7 years of age. I have been exposed to the world of computers at a very young age, we mostly played games only though. But, my brother‚Äôs interest developed and his love for computers eventually led him to become a software engineer. He loved doing maths, taught me as well, and I am very glad for it, as I stand here even with a commerce degree to have the strength to pursue a mathematically heavy course like Actuarial Science.\nGrateful to my parents, brother, other family members, and my dear friends, who have been thick-and-thin with me, since school. This is going to be the most I will write about my personal life, going forwards, hopefully some interesting post that will engage an audience. If any of this sounds interesting, stick around. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts too.\nThank you for reading, see you in the next one. üòä"
