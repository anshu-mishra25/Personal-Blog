This is my first post of the blog. Welcome!

I hope you've had a chance to read "About" section, which will reflect an up-to-date version of who I am. As of writing this 'Welcome' Post, I have finished my 2nd year *Bachelor of Commerce (Honours)* exams. I'm currently spending my summer vacation, sadly, without a summer internship (yet). So, I took a personal project for myself, and what could be better than starting a blog?

I'm also pursuing a career to become an Actuary, so preparing for my CS2 exam which is scheduled for September 2025. This blog will be a productive outlet for myself and even helpful for my career.

I feel like I've reached a where I can apply what I've learned over the years â€” in mathematics, statistics, finance, accounting, programming, etc, in a more practical manner. I've learnt basics of R Programming through taking CS1 Exam, and the basics of Python through an introductory course in college. Beyond that, internet has no limit, many great books teaching me more, like [*'R for Data Science'*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by *Hadley Wickham*, and [*'Python for Data Analysis'*](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)by *Wes McKinney* and a lot more out there!

This blog is my way of putting that knowledge into action by simplifying topics, writing for an audience, and getting over my hesitation to share publicly. Who knows, maybe I'll find great people who will read my blogs and take interest in connecting with me and who'll actually find my blogs helpful.

I've been an above-average kid for most of my life, lucky to be born-and-raised in Delhi, by my wonderful parents and an elder brother who's three years older than me. I chose Commerce field as the major in college (which I kind of regret), because it was supposedly an easier major, I hadn't decided what I really wanted to do at that point of time. Looking back, if I could choose again, I'd probably go for Economics or Statistics. But commerce gave me the freedom to explore, and learn whatever I wanted, but it also limited my formal learning in some ways.

My interest in statistics and probability really began in 12th grade only. I wasn't confident back then, so I chose the best college I could with my entrance exam score â€” *Shaheed Bhagat Singh College, University of Delhi*, is located in South Delhi. I, like some people, have a love-hate relationship with my college. I did find good college friends who I could spend time with, and the crowd has a variety with some genius people to some no-shit given people. It has been hectic juggling college life with a professional degree on the side, especially when the commute to the college is over 1.5 hours one sided! The attendance policy is strict, and due to construction, they also had to close down sports ground (goodbye volleyball â€” my love ðŸ˜”).

Ever since I was a kid, whatever my brother did, liked, I also tried and did. He requested our father for a computer when I was 6 or 7 years of age. I have been exposed to the world of computers at a very young age, we mostly played games only though. But, my brother's interest developed and his love for computers eventually led him to become a software engineer. He loved doing maths, taught me as well, and I am very glad for it, as I stand here even with a commerce degree to have the strength to pursue a mathematically heavy course like Actuarial Science.

Grateful to my parents, brother, other family members, and my dear friends, who have been thick-and-thin with me, since school. This is going to be the most I will write about my personal life, going forwards, hopefully some interesting post that will engage an audience. If any of this sounds interesting, stick around. Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts too.

Thank you for reading, see you in the next one. ðŸ˜Š
